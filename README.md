### Abstract

The Covid-19 Pandemic invigorated research into the issue of face-mask detection on images. A key motivator is the goal of better enforcement of mask mandates, many recent contributions on this topic focus on face-detection using deep learning approaches. We aim to contribute to the discourse by extending the scarce research on the performance of conventional Machine Learning algorithms. Therefore, we investigated the performance of different Machine Learning algorithms for image classification. We asses performance in terms of accuracy prediction and training speed. We achieved accuracy scores of well above 99% with atuned RF classifier for portrait images. A relevant result in light of possible resource constraints is that an SGD classifier performs more stable when tuned for accuracy and speed at around 96%, at a fraction of the training time.
The results indicate that neither classifiers usability is constrained by prediction time.
